## Usage

- Themes Storage: `./themes`
- Server config: `./vite.config.js`
- Data simulation: `./mock`

```js
const createMogThemeDevServerPlugin = require('./plugin.js');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    createMogThemeDevServerPlugin({
      themeId: "theme.test-theme.wibus"
    })
  ],
};
```

1. According to the directions on the https://mog.js.org/development/theme store in the theme folder to create a theme.
2. The theme id that needs to be applied in vite.config.js. (If not, the access path needs to be changed to `{THEME_ID}/{PAGE}`)
3. Configure the data simulation you need.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## Simulation Data [WIP]

> The content of this section has not yet been determined, and the content may change at any time. Please do not use it in a production environment.

The simulation data is stored in the `mock` folder, it's universal for all themes. It's a toml file, the key is the page, and the value is the data.

```toml
[global]
title = "Home"
description = "This is a home page"

[post]
title = "Post"
summary = "This is a post page"
text = "This is a post page, you can edit the mock.toml file to change the content."
```

## Theme

The theme is stored in the `themes` folder, it's a folder, the folder name is the theme id, and the folder contains the theme files.

```bash
themes
â””â”€â”€ theme.test-theme.wibus
    â”œâ”€â”€ post.ejs
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.ejs
    â””â”€â”€ ... # other files
```
