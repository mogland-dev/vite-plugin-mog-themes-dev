## Usage

- Themes Storage: `./themes`
- Server config: `./vite.config.js`
- Data simulation: `./mock`

```js
const createMogThemeDevServerPlugin = require('./plugin.js');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    createMogThemeDevServerPlugin({
      themeId: "theme.test-theme.wibus"
    })
  ],
};
```

1. According to the directions on the https://mog.js.org/development/theme store in the theme folder to create a theme.
2. The theme id that needs to be applied in vite.config.js. (If not, the access path needs to be changed to `{THEME_ID}/{PAGE}`)
3. Configure the data simulation you need.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## Simulation Data

Simulation data is automatically generated by `facker.js`, you can configure the data you need in `mock/mock.ts`. But please follow the type definition (in `@types`).

## Theme

The theme is stored in the `themes` folder, it's a folder, the folder name is the theme id, and the folder contains the theme files.

```bash
themes
â””â”€â”€ theme.test-theme.wibus
    â”œâ”€â”€ post.ejs
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.ejs
    â””â”€â”€ ... # other files
```
